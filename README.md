# Open-Feign
I created this project for understanding how Spring Gateway works and also learning manuel implementing of Spring Gateway. I used Open Feign for communicate services. Client' s url' s are represent my base project, for my base project you can check out my EmlakBurada repository.
You need to run your requests on port that you used in open-feign project, not the clients' s url. 
According to my project, I run my requests on port 8083. 
You can check out application.properties for well understanding.
